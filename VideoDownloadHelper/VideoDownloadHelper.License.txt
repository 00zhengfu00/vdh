This is an unofficial translation of the GNU General Public Licence into Traditional Chinese. It was not published by the Free Software Foundation, and does not legally state the distribution terms for software that uses the GNU GPL --- only the original American text of the GNU GPL does that. However, we hope that this translation will help Traditional Chinese speakers understand the GNU GPL better.

这是一份 GNU 通用公共授权的非官方繁体中文翻译。它并非由自由软件基金会 发布，也不是使用 GNU 通用公共授权的软件之法定发布条款－只有 GNU 通用公 共授权的英文原版具有这样的效力。然而，我们希望这份翻译能够帮助繁体中文 读者对 GNU 通用公共授权有更好地理解。

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE GNU 通用公共授權 Version 3, 29 June 2007 第三版, 2007年6月29日

Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/> Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

版权所有（C）2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. (http://fsf.org) 允许所有人复制和发布本授权文件的完整版本，但不允许对它进行任何修改。

导言 (Preamble)

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.

GNU 通用公共授权是一份针对软件和其他种类作品的自由的、公共的授权。

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.

大多数软件及其他具有实用价值的作品之授权是设计用以剥夺您共享和修改该 作品的自由。相反地，GNU 通用公共授权力图保证您分享和修改一个程序的所有 版本之自由－以确保软件对所有使用者都是自由的。本基金会对自己的大多数软 件都使用了 GNU 通用公共授权；本授权同样适用于任何其作者以这种方式发布 的作品。您也可以让您的程序使用本授权。

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

GNU 通用公共授权的设计是为了确保您拥有发布自由软件副本、以及为此收费的 自由，确保您能收到原始码或者在您需要时能获取原始码，确保您能修改软件或 者将它的一部分用于新的自由软件当中，并且确保您知道您能做这些事情。

To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

为了保障您的权利，我们需要禁止任何人否定您拥有这些权利，或者要求您放 弃这些权利。因此，当您散布此软件的副本或者修改它的时候，有些责任您必需 肩负，那就是，尊重他人的自由。

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

例如，如果您发布一个自由软件程序的副本，不管是免费的还是收费的，您都 必须把您获得的自由同样的给予副本的接收者。您必须确保他们也能收到或能获 得原始码。而且您必须向他们展示这些条款，以使他们知道自己享有这样的权利。

Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

使用 GNU 通用公共授权的开发者通过两项措施来保护您的权利：（1）声明软 体的版权，以及（2）向您提供本授权文件，以赋予您复制、散布及／或修改软件 的法律许可。

For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.

为了保护软件开发者和作者，GNU 通用公共授权明确阐释本自由软件没有任何 担保责任。为了用户和作者的利益，GNU 通用公共授权要求软件被修改过的版本 必须明确标示，从而避免它们的问题被错误地归咎于先前的版本。

Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

某些设备被设计成拒绝用户于该设备中安装或运行其软件的修改版本，尽管制 造商可以这么做。这从根本上是违背了保障用户能自由修改软件的目的。此滥用 都以千篇一律的模式出现在个人产品这方面，而这是最让人无法接受的。因此， 我们设计这个版本的 GNU 通用公共授权以禁止那些产品的这种做法。如果此类 问题在其他领域中大量湧现，我们已准备好在未来的 GNU 通用公共授权版本里 扩展这项条款，以保障用户的自由。

Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

最后，任何程序都经常受到软件专利的威胁。政府不应该让专利限制了一般用途 的计算机上的软件开发和使用，但对于允许这种事情的地区，我们希望能避免应用于 自由软件的专利会使到该软件变相成为私有化的危机。为了阻止这种事情发生， GNU 通用公共授权确保专利不会使到自由软件非自由化。

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.

以下是有关复制、发布和修改的明确条款和条件。

条款和条件 (TERMS AND CONDITIONS)

零、定义 (Definitions)
"This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

“本授权” 指 GNU 通用公共授权第三版。

"Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.

“版权” 亦指适用于其他着作(如半导体光罩)的着作权相关法律。

"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees" and "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

“本程序” 指 任何以本授权予以受权的可被版权保护之着作。被授权人称为“您 ”。“被授权人”和“接受者”可以是个人或组织。

To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

有别于一个完全的复制，“修改”着作指在需要获得版权许可的情况之下，复制或 改写该作品的全部或一部分。产出的作品被称为先前着作的“修改版本”或“基于” 先前着作的着作。

A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.

“涵盖作品”指未被修改过之程序 或 指基于本程序的着作。

To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.

“传播”作品指当您在没有获得许可的情况下，对该作品做出任何事，而这样做 会在可适用的版权法下让您承担直接或间接侵权者的责任，除非是在计算机上执行 该作品或是非公开地对它修改。传播包括复制，散布（无论带有修改与否）、向 公众共享、以及在某些国家的其他行为。

To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

“传递”作品指任何使其他人能够制作或接受副本的传播方式。仅仅通过计算机网 络和一个用户交流，而未涉及副本的传送，就不构成传达。

An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices" to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

一个显示“适当的法律通告”的交互用户界面要达到以下程度：包括一个方便而 显着的可视部件，且具备以下功能： （一）显示一个合适的版权通告；（2）告 诉用户该作品没有任何保固（除非它连保固也有提供），告诉受权人可 以在本授权下传达该作品，以及如何阅读本授权的副本。如果该界面显示了一个 包括用户命令或选项的列表，例如一个菜单，该列表中的一个显着选项就符合这 个条件。

一、原始码 (Source Code)
The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source form of a work.

一个作品的“原始码”指对作品作出修改时它的理想形式。“目标码”指作品的 任何非原始码形式。

A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.

“标准接口”指一个由一认可标准体系所定义的官方标准，或如该接口是为某一 特定编程语言而定义的话，那麽它是该语言中广为开发者所采用的。

The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A "Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

可执行作品的“系统函式库”除了不包括作品的整体以外，同时符合以下两个条 件的任何东西都包括在内：（一）包含在主要部件的正常包装形式中，但并不是 主要部件的一部份；（二）只是为了使到作品能与该主要部件使用，或是为了实 现某个已有公开原始码的标准接口。在这里，“主要部件”指的是在该可执行作品 下运行的作业系统（如有的话）当中的一个主要且不可或缺的部件（如核心、视 窗系统等），或用以产生该作品的一个编译器，或用以执行该作品的目标码解析 器。

The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.

对一目标码形式的作品而言，其“对应之原始码”指所有用以产生、安装以及（ 对可执行的作品而言）执行该目标码和修改作品的原始码，包括用以控制这些活 动的脚本。但是，它并不包括作品的系统函式库、通用工具以及在未经修改的情 况下，用以完成这些活动所需的、容易获得的以及并非作品一部份的自由软件。 对应之原始码的例子包括，与作品的原始码档相关联的接口定义档，以及如 因为与作品的其他部份之间有密切数据通讯或控制流程的缘故，作品所特定需要 的共享函式库和动态连接子程序之原始码，

The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.

对应之原始码不需要包含任何用户可以从对应之原始码的其他部份自动再生的 东西。

The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.

对一原始码形式的作品而言，其“对应之原始码”就是作品本身。

二、基本许可 (Basic Permissions)
All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

所有在本授权下赋予的权利是在授权程序的版权有效时期中被赋予的，而且只要所述的条件 都满足了，这些权利是不可撤回的。本授权明确申明您可以不受任何限制地执行授权程序的 未修改版本。倘若从执行一个被本授权含盖的作品而得到的输出结果，以及其内容，均构成被含盖的作品的话，那麽本授权对该输出结果亦适用。本授权承认版权法赋予您的公平使用或 其他相等原则中之权利。

You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

只要您的授权仍然有效，您可以无条件地制作、执行和转介一个并不是由您传播之授权含盖 的作品。当您只是需要别人仅仅为您修改一些被含盖的作品，或只是为了执行这些作品而 向您提供工具程序，您依然可以向别人传播这些作品，只要您遵守本授权的条款来传播那些您不能 控制版权的东西。为您而制作或执行那些被含盖的作品的人，必需是代表您而做，且是在 您的指导和控制之下，而在工作条款上必需禁止他们在与您的关系以外制作任何您拥有版 权的东西之副本。

Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.

如在其他情况下进行传递，只能在下述条件下发生。转授许可证授权是不被允许的，而第 十节亦使得它没有必要。

三、保护用户的法律权利不受反规避法侵犯 (Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law)
No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.

在任何实现1996年通过的世界知识产权组织版权条约第11章中所述任务的法律，或者是禁止或限制这种破解方法的类似法律下，复盖程序都不会被认定为有效的技术手段的一部分。

When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.

当您发布一个被涵盖的作品时，您同时放弃任何禁止技术措施规避行为的法律权利，条件是这些规避行为是在对该作品行驶本授权的权利时进行的。您亦放弃任何 限制操作或修改该作品的意图，而这样做的目的是为了对该作品的使用者执行您的或第三方的法律权利来禁止技术措施规避行为。

四、发布完整副本 (Conveying Verbatim Copies)
You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

当您收到本程序之原始码的时候，您可以通过任何媒介发布未被修改过的原始码副本，只要您显着而适当地在每个副本上都发布一个合适的版权通告；保持所有叙述本授权的通告，以及任何按照第七节中所述，对原始码所加入的非许可性条款的通告都完好无缺；保持所有免责声名完好无缺；并随本程序提供所有接受者一份本授权。

You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

您可以为每个发布的副本收取或不收取任何价格的费用，您也可以有偿的提供支援或责任担保。

五、发布修改过的原始版本 (Conveying Modified Source Versions)
You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

只要您同时满足以下所有条件，您可以在第四节的条款下以原始码形式发布一个基于本程序的作品，或一些用来从本程序制作该作品的修改：

   a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
   it, and giving a relevant date.
   一）该作品必须包含明确的通告说明您修改了它，并给出相应的修改日期。
    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
   released under this License and any conditions added under section
   7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
   "keep intact all notices".
   二）该作品必须包含明确的通告，说明它是在本授权以及任何按照第七节所加入的条件之下所发布的。这条要求修改了第四节的“保持所有通知完整”的要求。
   c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
   License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
   License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
   additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
   regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
   permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
   invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
c）您必须把整个软件作为一个整体向任何获取副本的人按照本授权协议授权。本授权因此会和任何按照第7节加入的条款一起，对整个软件及其所有部分，无论是以什么形式打包的，起法律效力。本授权不允许以其他任何形式授权该软件，但如果您个别地收到这样的许可，本授权并不否定该许可。
   d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
   Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
   interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
   work need not make them do so.
d）如果您制作的套装软件含交互的用户接口，每个用户接口都必须显示适当的法律通告；但是，如果本套装程序含没有显示适当的法律通告的交互接口，您的软件没有必要修改他们让他们显示。

A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.

如果一个复盖程序和其他本身不是该程序的扩展的程序的联合体，这样的联合的目的不是为了在某个存储或发布媒体上生成更大的程序，且联合体程序和相应产生的版权没有用来限制程序的使用或限制单个程序赋予的联合程序的用户的合法权利的时候，这样的联合体就被称为“聚集体”。在聚集体中包含复盖程序并不会使本授权应用于该聚集体的其他部分。

Conveying Non-Source Forms 6．发布非原始形式的副本
You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:

您可以在第4,5节条款下以目标码形式发布程序，只要您同时以一下的一种方式在本授权条款下发布机器可读的对应的原始码：

   a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
   (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
   Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
   customarily used for software interchange.
a）在实体产品（包括实体的发布媒介）中或作为其一部分发布目标码，并在通常用于软件交换的耐用实体媒介中发布对应的原始码。
   b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
   (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
   written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
   long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
   model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
   copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
   product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
   medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
   more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
   conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
   Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
b）在实体产品（包括实体的发布媒介）中或作为其一部分发布目标码，并附上有效期至少3年且与您为该产品模型提供配件或客户服务的时间等长的书面承诺，给予每个拥有该目标码的人两种选择（1）将本授权所复盖的产品，其所有软件的对应原始码的副本，置放在常用于软件交换的耐用实体媒介中，并以不高于您执行这种发布原始码所需合理费用收费；或（2）通过网络服务器免费提供这些对应原始码的访问。
   c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
   written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
   alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
   only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
   with subsection 6b.
c）独自发布目标码的副本，并附上一份提供对应原始码的书面承诺。这种行为只允许偶尔发生并不能盈利，且在您收到的目标码附有第6节b规定的承诺的时候。
   d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
   place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
   Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
   further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
   Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
   copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
   may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
   that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
   clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
   Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
   Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
   available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
d）在指定的地点（免费或收费地）提供发布的目标码的访问并在同样的地点以不增加价格的方式提供对应原始码的同样的访问权。您不需要要求接收者在复制目标码的时候一道复制对应的原始码。如果复制目标码的地点是网络服务器，对应的原始码可以在另外一个支援相同复制功能的服务器上（由您或者第三方运作），只要您在目标码旁边明确指出在哪里可以找到对应的原始码。无论什么样的服务器提供这些对应的原始码，您都有义务保证它在任何有需求的时候都可用，从而满足本条规定。
   e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
   you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
   Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
   charge under subsection 6d.
e）用点对点传输发布目标码，您需要按照第6节d的条款向大众免费提供其他的节点目标码和对应的原始码在哪里。

A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.

目标码中可分离的部分，其原始码作为系统库不包含在对应的原始码中，不需要包含在发布目标码的行为中。


A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.

“用户产品”指（1）“消费品”，即通常用于个人的、家庭的或日常目的的有形个人财产；或者（2）任何为公司设计或销售却卖给了个人的东西。在判断一个产品是否消费品时，有疑点的案例将以有利于复盖面的结果加以判断。对特定用户接收到的特定产品，“正常使用”指该类产品的典型的或通常的使用，无论该用户的特殊情况，或者该用户实际使用该产品的情况，或者该产品要求的使用方式如何。一个产品是否是消费品与该产品是否具有实质的经济上的、工业的或非消费品的用处无关，除非该用处是此类产品唯一的重要使用模式。

"Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.

用户产品的“安装资讯”指从对应来原的修改版本安装和执行该用户产品中包含的复盖程序的修改版本所需要的任何方法、过程、授权密钥或其他资讯。这些资讯必须足以保证修改后的目标码不会仅仅因为被修改过而不能继续执行。

If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).

如果您在本节条款下在用户产品中，或随同，或专门为了其中的使用，发布目标码程序，而在发布过程中用户产品的所有权和使用权都永久地或在一定时期内（无论此项发布的特点如何）传递给了接收者，在本节所述的条款下发布的对应的原始码必须包含安装资讯。但是如果您或者任何第三方组织都没有保留在用户产品上安装修改过的目标码的能力（比如程序被安装在了ROM上），那麽这项要求不会生效。

The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.

提供安装资讯的要求并没有要求为接收者修改或安装过的程序，或者修改或安装该程序的用户产品，继续提供支援服务、担保或升级。当修改本身实际上相反地影响了网络的运行，或者违反了网络通信的规则和协定时，网络访问可以被拒绝。

Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.

根据本节发布的对应原始码和提供的安装资讯必须以公共的档案格式发布（并以附加原始码的方式向大众公开），解压缩、阅读或复制这些资讯不能要求任何密码。

Additional Terms 7．附加条款
"Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.

“附加许可”是通过允许一些本授权的特例来补充本授权的条款。只要它们在使用法律下合法，对整个程序都生效的附加许可就应当被认为是本授权的内容。如果附加许可只是对本程序的一部分生效，那麽该部分可以在那些许可下独立使用，但整个程序是在本授权管理下，无论附加许可如何。


When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

当您发布复盖程序的副本时，您可以选择删除该副本或其部分的任何附加许可。（当您修改程序时，附加许可可能要求在某些情况下将自身删除）。您可以把附加许可放在资料里，加入到您拥有或能授予版权许可的复盖程序中。

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

尽管本授权在别处有提供，对于您加入到程序中的资料，您可以（如果您由该资料的版权所有者授权的话）用以下条款补充本授权：

   a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
   terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
a. 拒绝担保责任或以与本授权第15和16小节条款不同的方式限制责任；或者

   b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
   author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
   Notices displayed by works containing it; or
b. 要求保留特定的合理法律通告，或者该资料中或包含于适当法律通告中的该程序的作者贡献；或者


   c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
   requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
   reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
c. 禁止误传该资料的来源，或者要求该资料的修改版本以合理的方式标志为与原版本不同的版本；或者

   d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
   authors of the material; or
d. 限制以宣传为目的的使用该资料作者或授权人的姓名；或者

   e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
   trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
e. 保留授权在商标法下使用一些商品名称，商标或服务标记；或者

   f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
   material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
   it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
   any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
   those licensors and authors.
f. 要求任何发布该材料（或其修改版本）的人用对接收者的责任假设合同对授权人和资料作者进行保护，避免任何这样的假设合同直接造成授权人和作者的责任。

All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further restrictions" within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.

所有其他不许可的附加条款都被认为是第10节中的“进一步的约束”。如果您收到的程序或者其部分，声称自己由本授权管理，并补充了进一步约束，那麽您可以删除这些约束。如果一个授权档包含进一步约束，但是允许再次授权或者在本授权下发布，只要这样的进一步的约束在这样的再次授权或发布中无法保留下来，您就可以在复盖程序中加入该授权档条款管理下的资料。

If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.

如果您依据本小节向复盖程序添加条款,您必须在相关的原始档案中加入一个应用于那些档的附加条款的声明或者指明在哪里可以找到这些条款的通告。

Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.

附加的条款，无论是许可的还是非许可的条款，都可以写在一个单独的书面授权中，或者申明为例外情况；这两种方法都可以实现上述要求。

Termination 8．终止授权
You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).

您只有在本授权的明确授权下才能传播或修改复盖程序。任何其他的传播或修改复盖程序的尝试都是非法的，并将自动终止您在本授权下获取的权利（包括依据第11节第三段条款授予的任何专利授权）。

However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

然而，如果您停止违反本授权，那麽您从某个特定版权所有者处获取的授权许可能够以以下方式恢复（a）您可以暂时地拥有授权，直到版权所有者明确地终止您的授权；（b）如果在您停止违反本授权后的60天内，版权所有者没有以某种合理的方式告知您的违背行为，那麽您可以永久地获取该授权。

Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.

进一步地，如果某个版权所有者以某种合理的方式告知您违反本授权的行为，而这是您第一次收到来自该版权所有者的违反本授权的通知（对任何软件），并且在收到通知后30天内修正了违反行为，那麽您从该版权所有者处获取的授权将永久地恢复。

Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.

当您的授权在本节条款下被终止时，那些从您那获取授权的组织只要保持不违反本授权协议，其授权就不会被终止。您只有在授权被版权所有者恢复了之后才有资格依据第10节的条款获取该材料的新的授权。

Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies 9.获取副本不需要接受本授权
You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

您不需要为了接收或运行本程序的副本而接受本授权协议。仅仅是因为点对点传输获取副本引起传播行为，也不要求您接受本授权协议。然而，除了本授权外，任何授权协议都不能授予您传播或修改复盖程序的许可。因此，如果您修改或者传播了本程序的副本，那麽您就默认地接受了本授权。

Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients 10.下游接收者的自动授权
Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

每次您发布复盖程序，接收者都自动获得一份来自原授权人的依照本授权协议运行、修改和传播该程序的授权。依据本授权，您不为执行任何第三方组织的要求负责。

An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

“实体移转”是指一个组织的控制权或全部资产，或者拆分组织，或者合并组织的转移。如果复盖程序的传播是实体移转造成的，该移转中每一个接收本程序副本的组织都将获取一份其前身拥有的或者能够依据前面的条款提供的任何授权，以及从其前身获取程序对应的源始码的权利，如果前身拥有或以合理的努力能够获取这些源始码的话。

You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

您不可以对从本授权协议获取或确认的权利的执行强加任何约束。比如，您不可以要求授权费用，版税要求或对从本授权获取的权利的执行收取任何费用。您不可以发起诉讼（包括联合诉讼和反诉）声称由于制作、使用、销售、批发或者引进本程序或其任何一部分而侵犯了任何专利权。

Patents 11．专利权
A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

“贡献者”是在本授权下授予本程序或者本程序所基于的程序的使用权的版权所有者。这样的程序被成为贡献者的“贡献者版本”。

A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.

一个贡献者的“实质的专利声明”是该贡献者所有和控制的全部专利，无论已经获得的还是在将来获得的，那些可能受到某种方式侵犯的专利权。本授权允许制作、使用和销售其贡献者版本，但不包括那些只会由于对贡献者版本进一步的修改而受到侵犯的专利的申明。为此，“控制”一词包括以同本授权要求一致的方式给予从属授权的权利。

Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.

每个贡献者在该贡献者的实质的专利申明下授予您非独家的，全世界的，不需要版税的专利授权，允许您制作、使用、销售、批发、进口以及运行、修改和传播其贡献者版本内容。

In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To "grant" such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.

在以下三个小节中，“专利授权”指任何形式表达的不执行专利权的协议或承诺（例如使用专利权的口头许可，或者不为侵犯专利而起诉的契约）。向一个组织授予专利授权指做出这样的不向该组织提出强制执行专利权的承诺。

If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. "Knowingly relying" means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.

如果您在自己明确知道的情况下发布基于某个专利授权的复盖程序，而这个程序的对应的源代码并不能在本授权条款下通过网络服务器或其他有效途径免费地向公众提供访问，您必须做到：（1）使对应的源代码按照上述方法可访问；或者（2）放弃从该程序的专利授权获取任何利益；或者（3）以某种与本授权要求一致的方法使该专利授权延伸到下游的接收者。“在自己明确知道的情况下”指您明确地知道除了获取专利授权外，在某个国家您传播复盖程序的行为，或者接收者使用复盖程序的行为，会由于该专利授权而侵犯一个或多个在该国可确认的专利权，而这些专利权您有足够的理由相信它们是有效的。

If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.

在依照或者涉及某一次事务或安排时，如果您通过获取发布或传播复盖程序的传输版本，并给予接收该复盖程序的某些组织专利授权，允许他们使用，传播，修改或者发布该复盖程序的特殊版本，那麽您赋予这些组织的专利授权将自动延伸到所有该复盖程序及基于该程序的作品的接收者。

A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

一份专利授权是“有偏见的”，如果它没有在自身所复盖的范围内包含，禁止行使，或者要求不执行一个或多个本授权下明确认可的权利。以下情况，您不可以发布一个复盖程序：如果您与软件发布行业的第三方组织有协定，而该协定要求您根据该程序的发布情况向该组织付费，同时该组织在您们的协定中赋予任何从您那里获得复盖软件的组织一份有偏见的专利授权，要么（a）连同您所发布的副本（或者从这些副本制作的副本）；要么（b）主要为了并连同某个的产品或者包含该复盖程序的联合体。如果您签署该协议或获得该专利授权的日期早于2007年3月28日，那麽您不受本条款约束。

Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

本授权的任何部分不会被解释为拒绝或者限制任何暗含的授权或其他在适用专利权法下保护您的专利不受侵犯的措施。

No Surrender of Others' Freedom 12．不要放弃别人的自由
If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

如果您遇到了与本授权相矛盾的情况（无论是法庭判决，合同或者其他情况），它们不能使您免去本授权的要求。如果您不能同时按照本授权中的义务和其他相关义务来发布复盖程序，那麽您将不能发布它们。比如，如果您接受了要求您向从您这里或许本程序的人收取版税的条款，您唯一能够同时满足本授权和那些条款的方法是完全不要发布本程序。

Use with the GNU Affero General Public License 13．和GNU Affero通用公共授权一起使用
Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.

尽管本协议有其他防备条款，您有权把任何复盖程序和基于第三版GNU Affero通用公共授权的程序链结起来，并且发布该联合程序。本授权的条款仍然对您的复盖程序有效，但是GNU Affero通用公共授权第13节关于通过网络交互的要求会对整个联合体有效。

Revised Versions of this License 14．本授权的修订版
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

自由软件基金会有时候可能会发布GNU通用软件授权的修订版本和/或新版本。这样的新版本将会和现行版本保持精神上的一致性，但是可能会在细节上有所不同，以处理新的问题和情况。

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

每个版本都有一个单独的版本号。如果本程序指出了应用于本程序的一个特定的GNU通用公共授权版本号“以及后续版本”，您将拥有选择该版本或任何由自由软件基金会发布的后续版本中的条款和条件的权利。如果本程序没有指定特定的GNU通用公共授权版本号，那麽您可以选择任何自由软件基金会已发布的版本。

If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.

如果本程序指出某个代理可以决定将来的GNU通用公共授权是否可以应用于本程序，那麽该代理的接受任何版本的公开称述都是您选择该版本应用于本程序的永久认可。

Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.

后续的授权版本可能会赋予您额外的或者不同的许可。但是，您对后续版本的选择不会对任何作者和版权所有者强加任何义务。

Disclaimer of Warranty 15．免责申明
THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

在适用法律许可下，本授权不对本程序承担任何担保责任。除非是书面申明，否则版权所有者和/或提供本程序的第三方组织，“照旧”不承担任何形式的担保责任，无论是承诺的还是暗含的，包括但不限于就适售性和为某个特殊目的的适用性的默认担保责任。有关本程序质量与效能的全部风险均由您承担。如本程序被证明有瑕疵，您应承担所有必要的服务、修复或更正的费用。

Limitation of Liability 16．责任范围
IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

除非受适用法律要求或者书面同意，任何版权所有者，或任何依前述方式修改和/或发布本程序者，对于您因为使用或不能使用本程序所造成的一般性、特殊性、意外性或间接性损失，不负任何责任（包括但不限于，资料损失，资料执行不精确，或应由您或第三人承担的损失，或本程序无法与其他程序运作等），即便该版权所有者或其他组织已经被告知程序有此类损失的可能性也是如此。

Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16 17．第15和16节的解释
If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.

如果上述免责申明和责任范围不能按照地方法律条款获得法律效力，复审法庭应该采用最接近于完全放弃关于本程序的民事责任的法律，除非随同本程序的责任担保或责任假设合同是收费的。

怎样为您的新程序使用这些条款(How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs)

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

如果您开发了一个新程序，并且希望它最大限度地对公众有用，最好的办法就是把它变成自由软件， 这样任何人都可以在这些条款下修改和再发行这个软件。

To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

要做到这一点，需要把下面这个声明附在您的程序里。最保险的做法是，把这个声明加到每个源文件的开头，以最有效地声明授权排除。

   <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
   Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
     <用一行描述程序的名称与其用途简述>
     版权所有(C) <年份><作者姓名>

   This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
   it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
   the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
   (at your option) any later version.
本程序为自由软件；您可依据自由软件基金会所发表的GNU通用公共授权条款，对本程序再次发布和/或修改；无论您依据的是本授权的第三版，或（您可选的）任一日后发行的版本。

   This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
   but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
   MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the

本程序是基于使用目的而加以发布，然而不负任何担保责任；亦无对适售性或特定目的适用性所为的默示性担保。详情请参照GNU通用公共授权。

   You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
   along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
您应已收到附随于本程序的GNU通用公共授权的副本；如果没有，请参照 <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

同时附上如何以电子及书面信件与您联系的资料。

If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

如果程序进行终端对话模式运作，请在交互式模式开始时，输出以下提示：

   <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
   This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
   This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
   under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
<程序> 版权所有(C) <年份> <作者姓名> 本程序不负任何担保责任，欲知详情请键入'show w'。 这是一个自由软件，欢迎您在特定条件下再发布本程序；欲知详情请键入'show c'。

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, your program's commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".

所假设的指令'show w'与'show c'应显示通用公共授权的相对应条款。当然，您可以使用'show w'与'show c'以外的指令名称；对于图形用户接口，您可以用“关于”项代实现此功能。

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

如有需要，您还应该取得您的雇主（若您的工作为程序设计师）或学校就本程序所签署的“版权放弃承诺书”。欲知这方面的详情，以及如何应用和遵守GNU通用公共授权，请参考 <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>


The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License. But first, please read <http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.

GNU通用公共授权并不允许您将本程序合并到私有的程序中。若您的程序是一个子程序库，您可能认为允许私有的应用程序链结该库会更有用。如果这是您所想做的，请使用GNU松弛通用公共授权代替本授权。但这样做之前，请阅读 <http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>
